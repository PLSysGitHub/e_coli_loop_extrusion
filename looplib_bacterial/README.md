## Adapted looplib code for bacterial chromosomes

1D loop extrusion code forked from Anton Goloborodko's [github.com/open2c/looplib](https://github.com/open2c/looplib)

Edits include adding periodic boundary conditions for circular bacterial chromosomes, as well as implementing loop-extruder bypassing upon collisions
