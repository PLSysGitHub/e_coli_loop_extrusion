## 3D polymer simulation code

3D code forked from Hugo Brandao's [github.com/hbbrandao/bacterialSMCtrajectories](https://github.com/hbbrandao/bacterialSMCtrajectories)

Edits include a container class for storing information about bacteria to simulate, as well as the ability to load 1D loop extrusion data from files

Depending on the number of loop-extruders, running a set of 5 simulation trajectories can takes between a few days and a week on an average GPU

Simulation results can be downloaded from [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13908509)

### Requirements
To run the code, you need to install the looplib_bacterial code from this repository, as well as [polychrom](https://github.com/open2c/polychrom).
