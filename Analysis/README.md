## Analysis code

This directory contains Julia scripts for running and analyzing simulated data.

Statistics are calculated and saved in the directory **Stats**. The files can be downloaded from [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13908509).

Various plots are then made and saved in the directory **Plots**

Running the plotting scripts takes minutes, running the analysis scripts (especially fitting of orientation angles) can take upto an hour.
